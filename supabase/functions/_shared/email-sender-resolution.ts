/**
 * Which sender identity should an email use, and did it fall back?
 *
 * Deliberately ZERO imports and no Deno globals, so `node:test` can load it
 * directly (same shape as _shared/facebook-lead-mapping.ts). Tests:
 * src/lib/emailSenderResolution.test.ts
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Exactly one org of 30 ever received a payroll report. The other
 * 29 failed three different ways — 22 with no email settings row, 7 with an invalid
 * org-supplied Resend key, 1 with an unverified gmail.com sender domain — and not
 * one of those branches was reachable by a test, because the decision was welded to
 * `fetch` and `createClient`. Pulling the decision out makes every branch
 * addressable.
 *

/**
 * The platform sender. ONE named constant — there are already 11 inline copies of

 *
 * tidywisecleaning.com is the domain verified in Resend (confirmed 2026-08-13).
 * That matters more than it looks: a fallback sending from an unverified domain
 * would fail for the exact reason it exists to work around. Never fall back to
 * `noreply@resend.dev`, Resend's sandbox domain — the now-deleted
