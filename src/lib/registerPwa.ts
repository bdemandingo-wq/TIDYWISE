/**
 * Registers the service worker that makes TidyWise installable on desktop.
 *
 * NEVER on native. Capacitor bundles its own assets locally with no
 * `server.url`, so a worker caching inside that WebView would serve stale files
 * in the one environment where a reload cannot clear them — the same reason
 * `chunkReload` refuses to reload on native.
 *
 * NEVER in dev. A worker caching a dev server's output makes HMR lie about what
 * is on screen, which costs far more than the feature is worth locally.
 *
 * The update is OFFERED, not applied. `registerType: 'prompt'` means a new
 * worker installs and then waits; nothing about the running tab changes until
 * the person says so. Taking over mid-session is what produces a chunk-load
 * error, because the tab's already-parsed index.html points at assets the new
 * worker has replaced.
 *
 * Declining is safe: `cleanupOutdatedCaches` is false, so the old chunks a
 * long-lived tab still needs remain resolvable rather than 404ing.
