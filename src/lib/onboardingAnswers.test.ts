// Onboarding qualifying answers — shape, persistence payload, and the plan
// recommendation derived from them.
//
// Runner: node:test (vitest is not installed in this repo; 15 other specs in
// src/lib use this same runner). The module under test must have ZERO imports:
//
//   node --experimental-strip-types --test src/lib/onboardingAnswers.test.ts
//
// WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. Onboarding asks four qualifying questions and throws
// every answer away — they go to sessionStorage and are read once by
// /choose-plan. This change adds a fifth question ("How did you hear about
// us?"), persists all five to organizations.onboarding_answers, and turns every
// question multi-select.
//
// That last part is what makes a spec necessary rather than nice-to-have. The
// answers change shape from string to string[], and EVERY existing consumer
// fails silently on the new shape:
//
//   ChoosePlanPage:125  a.teamSize === 'large'      -> false for ['large']
//   ChoosePlanPage:169  PAIN_PITCH[a.biggestPain]   -> undefined for an array
//   ChoosePlanPage:361  personal.teamSize ? ... : ..-> [] is TRUTHY, so an
//                                                      unanswered question
//                                                      reads as answered
//   OnboardingPage:531  PAIN_BUILD_LINE[...]        -> undefined, silent fallback
//
// Not one of those throws. The page renders, everyone quietly gets 'pro', and
// the personalised copy quietly disappears. Pulling the logic into one pure
// module is what makes those four cases assertable at all.
//
