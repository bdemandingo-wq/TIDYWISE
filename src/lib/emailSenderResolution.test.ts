// Which sender identity should an email use, and did it fall back?

// Runner: node:test, which runs here (Node v24 strips TypeScript natively and the
// module under test is import-free by design):
//
//   node --experimental-strip-types --test src/lib/emailSenderResolution.test.ts
//
// WHY A PURE MODULE. The bug this fixes is a set of untested branches welded to
// `fetch` and `createClient`: exactly one org of 30 ever received a payroll report
// and the other 29 failed three different ways, none of which any test could
// reach. Pulling the DECISION out of the I/O makes every branch addressable.
// See docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-13-owner-email-platform-fallback.md
//
// The rule the whole file encodes: an internal report to an owner about their own
// business must not depend on that org having configured a customer-facing sender
// — but a customer-facing email must still fail closed, because silently sending a
// business's customer mail from TidyWise's address is worse than not sending.
