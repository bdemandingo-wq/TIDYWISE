/**
 * Pure rendering + validation for platform broadcast emails.
 *
 * Deliberately ZERO imports and no Deno globals, so Node v24 can strip the
 * types natively and the colocated test needs no bundler.
 *
 * KEEP IN SYNC: `supabase/functions/_shared/broadcast-render.ts` is a verbatim
 * copy below this header, because the senders run in Deno and cannot import
 * from `src/`. This copy is canonical. broadcast-render.test.ts imports both
 * and asserts they agree.
 *
 * The load-bearing rule encoded here: the unsubscribe line is appended at
 * RENDER time from a url the caller supplies, and is never part of the stored
 * body. This mirrors withStopSentence() on the SMS side, and for the same
 * reason — an operator rewording their copy must not be able to drop it.
 *
 * The signature is appended at render time too. It DEFAULTS to
 * DEFAULT_SIGNATURE below and is only overridden by a stored value, because an
 * optional signature failed silently: an empty compose box sent 96 owners an
 * unsigned email and nothing anywhere reported it. There is now no input that
 * produces an unsigned broadcast.
 *
 * It is still escaped, even though the default is a constant we own. A stored
 * signature_text from the database is not something this module controls, and
 * having one escaping rule for both paths is what stops the trusted-looking
 * default from teaching the next reader that the stored path is safe too. The
 * cost is that it carries no markup — mail clients auto-linkify bare addresses
 * and phone numbers, which covers the actual use.
 *
 * The signature also applies to BOTH classes, unlike the unsubscribe footer.
 * It is deliberately a separate parameter rather than something derived from
 * `unsubscribeUrl`, because deriving it would silently make it marketing-only.

 * an exception for "the one we own" teaches the next reader that the stored
