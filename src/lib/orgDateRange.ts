 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * On 2026-07-31 the dashboard's gross volume read $888 on a Miami computer and
 * $616 on a phone in Manila. `AdminDashboard` filtered with date-fns `isToday`,
 * which compares against the BROWSER's calendar day. Manila is twelve hours
 * ahead of EDT, so the phone's "today" ran from noon on 31 July to noon on
 * 1 August in Miami terms — a band spanning two business days and matching
 * neither. Thirty files across the app compute windows that way.
 *
 * The rule this module exists to hold: **a business day starts and ends in the
 * business's timezone.** Where the person looking happens to be standing is
 * never part of the answer.
 *
 * WHY NOT date-fns-tz
 * It isn't installed, and this network has been unable to add packages all
 * session. `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with a timeZone is in every browser this app
 * supports and handles DST correctly, because the IANA database is what it
 * reads. The offset maths below is the standard trick for inverting it.
