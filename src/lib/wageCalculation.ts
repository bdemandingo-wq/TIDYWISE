/**
 * Shared wage calculation — the READ side counterpart to lib/cleanerPay.ts.
 *
 * Every surface that DISPLAYS a cleaner's pay calls resolveCleanerPay():
 * - Admin Payroll page (PayrollPage.calcWage)
 * - Cleaner Portal Earnings (CleanerEarnings)
 * - Cleaner Portal job cards (MyJobCard, AvailableJobCard)
 *
 * RULE: this file mirrors the payout engine
 * (supabase/functions/_shared/payroll-period-process.ts) exactly — same
 * priority order, same computed fallback. That engine is what actually pays
 * cleaners, so anything shown to a cleaner or to payroll must be what it
 * would pay. There is deliberately no fourth answer.
 *
 * Priority (identical to payroll-period-process.ts:calcWage):
 *   1. booking_team_assignments.pay_share  (per-cleaner, > 0)
 *   2. booking.cleaner_pay_expected        (booking-level snapshot)
 *   3. booking.cleaner_actual_payment      (legacy admin override, incl. $0)
 *   4. computed from wage type / rate / hours
 *
 * The ONE deliberate deviation is documented on getActualHours() below.
 *
 * NOTE: staff.percentage_rate is intentionally NOT read here. The payout
 * engine selects that column but never uses it in its wage math, so a
 * percentage_rate cleaner with no booking-level wage really is paid from
 * base_wage/hourly_rate (or $0). Adding it here would make the screens
 * promise money payroll does not pay. Fix the engine first if that's wrong.
