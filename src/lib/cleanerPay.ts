 *
 * Only single-cleaner bookings are touched: if the booking has 0 assignments

 * is per-member) we leave it alone rather than clobbering it with a

 *   - a staffId → the lone assignment is MOVED to them if it belongs to someone
 *     else. A booking whose staff_id has no assignment row still gets paid out
 *     of the booking-level snapshot, on top of the assignment holders, so the
 *     two must be reassigned together.
 *   - null (booking unassigned) → nothing is written. The pay computed for a
 *     booking with no cleaner must not land on a previous cleaner's row.
