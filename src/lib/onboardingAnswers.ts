/**
 * Onboarding qualifying answers — shape, plan recommendation, and DB payload.
 *
 * Deliberately ZERO imports and no browser globals, so `node:test` can load it
 * directly. Tests: src/lib/onboardingAnswers.test.ts
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Onboarding asks qualifying questions whose answers were
 * `string`. Making them multi-select turns them into `string[]`, and every
 * existing consumer breaks SILENTLY on that change — nothing throws, the page
 * renders, and the damage is invisible:
 *
 *   ChoosePlanPage:125  a.teamSize === 'large'       false for ['large']
 *   ChoosePlanPage:169  PAIN_PITCH[a.biggestPain]    undefined for an array
 *   ChoosePlanPage:361  personal.teamSize ? x : y    [] is TRUTHY
 *   OnboardingPage:531  PAIN_BUILD_LINE[...]         undefined, silent fallback
 *
 * Those live inside JSX and vitest is not installed, so they were untestable
 * where they sat. Moving the decisions here is what makes them assertable.
 *
 * See docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-13-onboarding-acquisition-question.md
