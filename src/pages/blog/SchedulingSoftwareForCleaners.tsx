              Scheduling a cleaning business isn't like scheduling a dentist appointment. You're assigning specific cleaners to specific clients, managing recurring jobs, handling last-minute cancellations, optimizing drive routes, and keeping clients informed — all while billing correctly and paying staff accurately. Generic scheduling tools don't handle this. Here's what cleaning-specific scheduling software actually does, and what to look for.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Why Generic Scheduling Tools Fall Short for Cleaning Businesses</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Most scheduling apps are built for single-location businesses with walk-in appointments. Cleaning businesses have fundamentally different needs:
            </p>
            <ul className="space-y-3 text-muted-foreground list-none pl-0">
              {[
                { title: "Multiple simultaneous jobs", desc: "You might have 3 teams at different addresses at the same time — the software needs to track all of them independently." },
                { title: "Recurring schedules with exceptions", desc: "A client books bi-weekly cleanings, skips one, then wants to add a deep clean for the next visit. This kind of flexibility breaks basic scheduling tools." },
                { title: "Cleaner assignment logic", desc: "Some clients request specific cleaners. Some cleaners can only drive to certain areas. The software needs to support these constraints." },
                { title: "Square footage and room-based pricing", desc: "Cleaning pricing depends on home size and number of bathrooms — not session length. Your scheduling tool needs to calculate job duration and price from property details, not just block time." },
                { title: "Integration with payments and payroll", desc: "A completed job should automatically trigger an invoice and a payroll entry. Disconnected tools mean manual data entry and errors." },
              ].map((f) => (
                <li key={f.title} className="flex gap-3">
                  <span className="text-primary font-bold mt-1">→</span>
                  <div><strong className="text-foreground">{f.title}.</strong> {f.desc}</div>
                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Core Features of Cleaning Business Scheduling Software</h2>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Online Booking with Instant Quotes</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Clients should be able to book without calling you. Good scheduling software includes a public booking page where clients enter their home details (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage), see an instant price, and pick a time slot. Bookings go directly into your schedule — no manual entry.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Automated Cleaner Assignments</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              When a booking comes in, the software should suggest available cleaners based on their schedule, location, and any client preferences. Some platforms let you set rules (e.g., always assign Sarah to recurring clients, never assign new cleaners to high-value properties). This saves 30+ minutes of manual scheduling per day for a typical 5-person operation.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Drag-and-Drop Calendar</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Visual scheduling is essential. You need to see all jobs, all cleaners, all time slots at once — and be able to reassign or reschedule with a drag. When a cleaner calls in sick, you need to immediately see who's available and move their jobs without rebuilding the schedule from scratch.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Automated SMS and Email Reminders</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              No-shows and last-minute cancellations cost money. Automated reminders sent 24-48 hours before the job — and the morning of — reduce no-show rates significantly. Clients should be able to confirm, reschedule, or cancel directly from the reminder, without calling you.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Route Optimization</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              When you have multiple jobs in a day, the order they're scheduled in determines how much your cleaners drive. Scheduling software with route optimization clusters nearby jobs and sequences them to minimize travel time — often recovering 1-2 hours of productive time per cleaner per day.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Recurring Job Management</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Most cleaning revenue comes from recurring clients. Your software needs to handle weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly schedules automatically — with the ability to skip dates, add one-off services, or change frequency without breaking the recurring pattern. Cancellations should also automatically offer to reschedule rather than just removing the booking.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">What to Look for Beyond the Basics</h2>
            <div className="bg-muted/50 rounded-xl p-5 space-y-4">
              <div>
                <p className="font-semibold text-foreground">Integration with payroll:</p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm mt-1">Completed jobs should automatically calculate cleaner wages, tips, and mileage. Manual payroll calculation from scheduling data is a major time sink and error source.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p className="font-semibold text-foreground">Mobile app for cleaners:</p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm mt-1">Cleaners need to see their schedule, get client details, mark jobs complete, and upload photos — from their phone. A web-only admin interface doesn't serve field staff.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p className="font-semibold text-foreground">Real-time updates:</p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm mt-1">When you reassign a job or update a booking, cleaners should see the change instantly on their app — not at the next sync or the next morning.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p className="font-semibold text-foreground">Client portal:</p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm mt-1">Clients who can self-manage their bookings (view upcoming jobs, request changes, update payment info) generate fewer support calls and have higher retention.</p>

            </div>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Comparing Scheduling Software Options</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              The main options for cleaning business scheduling fall into three categories:
            </p>
            <ul className="space-y-3 text-muted-foreground list-none pl-0">
              {[
                { title: "Cleaning-specific platforms", desc: "TIDYWISE, ZenMaid, Launch27. Built for cleaning businesses — they handle square footage pricing, recurring schedules, and cleaner management natively. Higher feature density for cleaning, but less flexibility for non-cleaning operations." },
                { title: "Field service generalists", desc: "Jobber, Housecall Pro. Work for cleaning businesses but are designed for any field service (HVAC, plumbing, landscaping). May lack cleaning-specific features like room-by-room checklists or square footage pricing." },
                { title: "Generic scheduling tools", desc: "Acuity, Calendly, Square Appointments. Fine for solo operators or simple appointment-based businesses. Outgrown quickly once you have multiple cleaners and recurring clients." },
              ].map((f) => (
                <li key={f.title} className="flex gap-3">
                  <span className="text-primary font-bold mt-1">→</span>
                  <div><strong className="text-foreground">{f.title}.</strong> {f.desc}</div>
                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">What Scheduling Alone Can't Solve</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Scheduling software is most valuable when it's connected to the rest of your operations. A standalone scheduling tool that doesn't sync with invoicing means double-entry. One that doesn't connect to payroll means manual wage calculations. One without a mobile cleaner app means your team is still texting for schedule updates.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              The best scheduling software for cleaning businesses isn't just a calendar — it's the operational core that everything else connects to.
