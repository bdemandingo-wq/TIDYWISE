              Payroll is one of the most time-consuming parts of running a cleaning business. Between tracking hours, calculating tips, handling mileage reimbursements, and staying compliant with tax withholding — it adds up fast. The right payroll software can cut that time to minutes per pay period.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Why Cleaning Businesses Need Dedicated Payroll Software</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Generic payroll software like QuickBooks or Gusto wasn't built for the cleaning industry. They don't understand per-job wages, tip splits, mileage-based pay, or the reality of part-time cleaners working variable hours. You end up doing manual math in spreadsheets — which defeats the purpose.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Cleaning-specific payroll software handles the nuances: flat per-job rates, percentage-of-job pay, team splits, tip distribution, and automatic deductions — all calculated from the jobs your cleaners actually completed.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Key Features to Look For</h2>
            <ul className="space-y-3 text-muted-foreground list-none pl-0">
              {[
                { title: "Per-job wage calculation", desc: "Automatically calculates cleaner pay based on completed jobs — flat rate, hourly, or percentage of service price." },
                { title: "Tip tracking and distribution", desc: "Tracks customer tips and distributes them to the right cleaners automatically." },
                { title: "Mileage reimbursement", desc: "Calculates mileage from job to job and applies the IRS reimbursement rate (or your custom rate)." },
                { title: "Tax withholding", desc: "Handles federal and state tax withholding, W-2/1099 generation, and quarterly filings." },

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Top Payroll Options for Cleaning Businesses</h2>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">1. TIDYWISE — Best for All-in-One Management</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              TIDYWISE includes built-in payroll designed specifically for cleaning companies. Wages are calculated automatically from completed bookings — you don't have to manually tally hours. Set flat rates, hourly rates, or a percentage of the job price per cleaner. Tips, bonuses, and deductions are all handled inside the same system as your scheduling and invoicing. No export, no reconciling separate tools.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              <strong className="text-foreground">Best for:</strong> Cleaning businesses that want payroll, scheduling, CRM, and invoicing in one place.<br />
              <strong className="text-foreground">Price:</strong> Free forever.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">2. Gusto — Best for Full-Service Payroll</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Gusto is a standalone payroll platform with strong compliance and benefits management. It handles W-2 and 1099 workers, tax filings, and direct deposit well. The downside for cleaning businesses: it doesn't integrate with cleaning-specific scheduling software natively, so you'll be entering hours manually or paying for a third-party integration.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              <strong className="text-foreground">Price:</strong> Starting at $40/month + $6/employee/month.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">3. QuickBooks Payroll — Best for Accounting Integration</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              If you're already using QuickBooks for accounting, their payroll add-on is a natural extension. It handles tax calculations and filings reliably. But like Gusto, it's not built for variable per-job wage structures — you'll need to manually input what each cleaner earned each pay period.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              <strong className="text-foreground">Price:</strong> Starting at $45/month + $6/employee/month.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">4. Housecall Pro + Gusto — Best Integration Combo</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Housecall Pro integrates with Gusto for payroll. If you're already on Housecall Pro, this is a cleaner option than manually moving data. Still requires separate subscriptions and the integration has limitations.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              <strong className="text-foreground">Price:</strong> Housecall Pro starts at $65/month; Gusto is additional.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">How TIDYWISE Payroll Works</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              In TIDYWISE, every completed booking automatically feeds your payroll report. Here's the flow:
            </p>
            <ol className="space-y-3 text-muted-foreground list-none pl-0">
              {[
                "Set each cleaner's wage type — flat per-job, hourly rate, or % of service price",
                "As bookings are completed and marked in the system, wages calculate automatically",
                "View the payroll summary by pay period — see gross pay, deductions, and net per cleaner",
                "Export the payroll report or process payment directly",
                "Cleaners can see their own earnings through the staff portal on their phone",
              ].map((step, i) => (
                <li key={i} className="flex gap-3">
                  <span className="text-primary font-bold mt-1 flex-shrink-0">{i + 1}.</span>
                  <span>{step}</span>
                </li>
              ))}
            </ol>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">What to Do About 1099 vs W-2 for Cleaners</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              This is the most common compliance question for cleaning business owners. Whether your cleaners are W-2 employees or 1099 contractors depends on how much control you have over their work — tools used, schedule set, work process dictated. Most cleaning companies with assigned routes and fixed schedules should classify cleaners as W-2 employees.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Misclassification carries serious tax penalties. Consult a CPA if you're unsure. TIDYWISE supports both employee and contractor pay structures and generates the correct documentation for each.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Bottom Line</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              If you're running payroll manually in a spreadsheet, you're losing hours every two weeks — and introducing errors. The best payroll software for your cleaning business depends on your size and how integrated you want your tools to be.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              For most cleaning companies under 20 cleaners, TIDYWISE covers payroll, scheduling, and invoicing in one free platform. Larger operations or those with complex tax situations may want to add Gusto for full-service compliance support.
            </p>
