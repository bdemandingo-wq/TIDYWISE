 * Canonical TidyWise Terms of Service.
 *
 * Single source of truth: rendered in the signup dialog AND at /terms, and the
 * REFUND_POLICY / CANCELLATION_POLICY strings below are what the dispute
 * evidence pipeline submits to Stripe — keep them in sync with the sections
 * of the same name. supabase/functions/_shared/policies.ts holds a verbatim
 * copy for edge functions to import; update both together.
 *
 * When you materially change the terms, bump TOS_VERSION (date format). New
 * acceptances record the new version; old tos_acceptances rows keep theirs,
 * which is exactly what you want for dispute evidence.
 *
 * NOTE: reviewed for dispute-evidence completeness, not by a lawyer. Have
 * counsel skim before relying on it in litigation (Stripe disputes are fine).
